# Detection of Textual Cyberbullying

## Abstract

Create a model which will carry out the detection of textual cyber bullying with the highest possible accuracy using machine learning techniques.

## Methods

Using bad of words and Td-Idf on our dataset
Then use train and test split, 10-fold cross validation
Our test and train data is passed through to the following classifier:
- Linear SVM
- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
Results are measured using:
- Classification report (f1 score, accuracy, precision, recall)
- Confusion Matrix
- Kappa Score
- T-test
Results are plotted using matplotlib

## Languages & Tools Used

Sci-Kit Learn, Python3.6, XML, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib
